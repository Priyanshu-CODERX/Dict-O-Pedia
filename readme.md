# Dict-O-Pedia
#### This is a Dictionary application made with React Native, you can learn the meanings of some words and also learn how to pronounce them.

# Tools
#### So, I used some tools to develop this application. I used an API to fetch the data and expo-av audio to play the pronounciations.
* [expo-av](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/audio/)
